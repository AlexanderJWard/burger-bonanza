# Burger Bonanza


## Author

## Project Overview

Burger Bonanza is a javascript memory game based around remembering a customers burger order for a set amount of time based on difficulty. The order then dissapears and the player has to replicate the customers order in the selection window. After pressing submit the game will then inform the player if they are correct or wrong and tally the score, there are also cross or check marks against each selection so the player know exactly which part of their answer was correct or wrong. Burger Bonanza can be enjoyed by people of all ages however due to it fairly simple mechanics and forgiving difficulties it's more aimed towards children.

### Project Goals

The goal of the website is to provide the player with entertainment and education achieved through a memory puzzle. There are three difficulties to appeal to people of all ages and give players the choice if they want an easy and relaxing experience or maybe they want the harder difficulty to challenge their memory skills.

### Design Choices

#### Colors

I've chosen colors that fit the food and burger theme to tie together the difficulties to the Burger Bonanza vibe but also differentiates themseleves so each difficulty is distinguished and easily recognisable as that specific difficulty when switching between them. The green color is called Android color and is similar to a cucumber or pickle color and is used for the easy difficulty. Yellow is called Mustard and is meant to represent the condiment used on burgers, this is used for the medium difficulty. Finally, I used a red called Vermilion which is very close to a Ketchup / red sauce color and is used in the hard difficulty.

- #B6C94B - Android Green
- #FFDB58 - Mustard
- #DD3522 - Vermilion

#### Typography

The font I've used through-out Burger Bonanza has been __Fredoka One__ due to it's very thick and curvy approach which contains no sharp points, I think it fits the theme for a burger restaraunt style game very well and is readable for all age groups but esspecially for children so for me the main attraction was that the font needs to look fun from first viewing it.

#### Images

Background image containing lots of colorful burgers stacked on top of each other to show players the game is burger related from just a quick glance when the background image loads. This image is attributed in the code and also further down in CREDITS section.

The burger buns and food choices inside the burgers are colorful and obvious what they all are immediately. These images are used in the initial burger order question, the answer boxes and the selection boxes when the player is choosing.
